     * Copies data from the source patch to the destination patch. The difference
     * to the method copyGhostLayerDataBlock is that in this method a discrete
     * part (i.e. a rectangular block of cells) is specified in the destination
     * patch while the appropriate part from the source block is determined by
     * the positions, sizes and subdivision factors of the patches. Therefore,
     * this method also works on patches which have different subcell sizes, due
     * to level or subdivision factor.
     * This method performs a mapping from continuous points in one patch to the
     * discrete cells in the other patch. We use a d-linear interpolation. Since
     * for fine cells we might need information outside the source patch, we use
     * d-linear extrapolation for this.
     *
     * The two parameters interpolateToUOld and interpolateToCurrentTime are
     * helpers while the UNew array does not hold a ghostlayer. There are three
     * situations when an interpolation is performed:
     *
     *  - Filling of ghostlayer: Interpolating to UOld array but using the time
     *    of UNew
     *  - Interpolating to UNew of new patch: Interpolating to UNew array and
     *    using the time of UNew
     *  - Interpolating to UOld of new patch: Interpolating to UOld array and
     *    using the time of UOld
