/**
 * In this class all functionality for transferring data
 * up or down through the spacetree is implemented.
 *
 * Every spacetree node is considered to contain a patch. However,
 * since we're implementing a mostly non-overlapping approach, not
 * all of these patches hold valid grid data. But all of them
 * contain time information. So, each patch is thought of spanning
 * a time interval.
 *
 * @see peanoclaw::Patch for further information about this.
 *
 * !!! Virtual Patches
 * There are three possible situations when a virtual patch needs to be created.
 *
 * !! Refined patch along a refinement boundary
 *
 * @image html virtual-patches-conditions-0.png
 *
 * When a patch is refined but has an unrefined neighbor on the same level, it
 * needs to become a virtual patch in this iteration. In this situation at least
 * one vertex needs to be in the state Unrefined (as long as the grid is static).
 * If the grid is not static we are in the next situation.
 *
 * !! Refined patch neighboring a refining patch
 *
 * @image html virtual-patches-conditions-1.png
 *
 * If an already refined patch has a refining neighbor, it needs to become a virtual
 * patch during this grid iteration. In this state at least on adjacent vertex is
 * in the state Refining.
 *
 * !! Erasing patch
 *
 * @image html virtual-patches-conditions-2.png
 *
 * If fine patches are about to be erased, the containing coarse patch needs to
 * become a virtual patch that later will be the new coarse patch at this part
 * of the grid. In this case at least one vertex is in the state Erasing.
 *
 * !! Condition for creating virtual patches
 *
 * In all three cases at least one vertex is in one of the states Unrefined,
 * Refining, Erasing. Thus, at least one vertex is not in the state Refined
 * (Since the check is done in the enterCell event, the states
 * Refinement_Triggered and Erasing_Triggered already have been switched to
 * Refining and Erasing). This is the used condition for determining wether
 * a refined patch should become a virtual one.
