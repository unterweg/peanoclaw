/**
 * A probe defines a point on which the solution is plotted every time

 * Hence, a probe consists of a position and a value determining the
 * unknown from the solution that should be plotted. Furthermore a
 * probe has a name to identify it in the output.
 * The output that is plotted contains the current solution value
 * and the time on which the patch currently resides.
 *
 * If the index for the unknown is set to -1 all unknowns in the
 * solution are plotted in a row.
